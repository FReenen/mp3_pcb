# ANE10 PCB 2 - MP3 Speler

   This is work in progress!

A MP3 player with a ethernet interface.

## interface

   Work in progress.

## voeding

Thare a two power supplies on the board. One for het analog circuitry and
one for the part. Thes power rails are isolated. If you want to use
two separate power supplies to improve audio quality you can.

Both power supplies don't have to be regulated and support a range of 10
to 30 V.

## housing

   Work in progress.

The idea is to make a sort of rack to 'click' it in as a card,
that's why there is a weird cutout on the board.
